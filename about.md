# Monte Carlo Method explained in 7 minutes
On that mini-course you'll learn what's about Monte Carlo Method.
It's a hand-on course, there will be some little simple theory.
The rest will be executable exercises for solving:
 
-  Area calculation of arbitrary shapes on a 2D plane.
-  On an hypothetical game, searching the best combo possible.

You can also modify that code to test it as you like!

## Previous Knowledge:
Basic programming knowledge: Variables, Loops, Functions, Random Numbers.
C++ is used on the Course, for performance reasons.

## Difficulty Level: 
Intermediate.

## Estimated Time:
7 minutes!

## What will I learn?
Students will learn a basic grasp about Monte Carlo Experiments.
 
## Why should I learn?
Monte Carlo is a simple approach for problems that are easy to evaluate but hard to find the best solution.

## That's good until someone releases a 6 minute explanation!

No! No, no, not 6! I said 7. Nobody's comin' up with 6. Who does Monte Carlo in 6 minutes? You won't even get your pseudorandom numbers seeded, not even a mouse on a wheel.
7's the key number here. Think about it. 7-Elevens. 7 dwarves. 7, man, that's the number. 7 chipmunks twirlin' on a branch, eatin' lots of sunflowers on my uncle's ranch.
