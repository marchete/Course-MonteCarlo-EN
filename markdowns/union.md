# Area Calculation - Union

In this example there are N overlapping shapes, and we seek the UNION area of all those shapes.
Press `RUN MY CODE` to see how areas are calculated using Monte Carlo:

@[Union Areas]({"stubs": ["union/union.cpp"], "command": "./union/Union"})

In that case I can't calculate the accuracy because the reference area calculation is not trivial.
