# Final words

This is the final lesson of that mini course. The idea was demystifying Monte Carlo, and teach people how to make use of it with some live examples.

**Pros**

- Simple method, the whole pseudo code is like 9 lines.
- Good results in many cases.
- Low memory usage.

**Cons**

- It's suboptimal, it doesn't guarantee a good solution, and even less the optimal one.
- It doesn't learn, each test is independent from others. There are others search methods like Genetic Algorithms that tries to use good solutions for searching better ones.
- Time consuming. It takes a lot of processor time compared to mathematical methods.
- As other search solutions it's very dependent on simulation and evaluation quality. If you have a bad simulation you can't score the outcome correctly, because what you simulated it isn't accurate.
