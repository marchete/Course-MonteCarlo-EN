# Area Calculation - Intersection

In this example there are N overlapping shapes, and we seek the INTERSECTION area of all those shapes.
Press `RUN MY CODE` to see how areas are calculated using Monte Carlo:

@[Intersection Areas]({"stubs": ["intersection/intersection.cpp"], "command": "./intersection/Intersection"})

In that case I can't calculate the accuracy because the reference area calculation is not trivial.
